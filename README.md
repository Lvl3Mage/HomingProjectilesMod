# HomingProjectilesMod
Adds different types of projectile homing to raot. Must be installed on the server.
## Homing Types:
### Default
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 0**.

Projectiles act the same way as they normally do.

### Ranged
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 1**.

Projectiles travel really quickly in a straight line. Very hard to hit anything but satisfying when you do.

### Homing
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 2**.

Projectiles arc towards the nearest player. More casually oriented since hitting targets becomes really easy.

### RangedHoming
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 3**.

A mix between the the Ranged and Homing modes. Projectiles travel really quickly and arc towards players. A little unreliable but makes it pretty easy to hit far away shots.

### Hitscan
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 4**.

Projectiles teleport instantly to players within a 10 degree cone in front of you. Fairly unreliable and needs some work but pretty fun in a casual setting nonetheless.

### Wired
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 5**.

Projectiles target an invisible point that travels forwards along your view. This makes it possible to curve projectiles towards players by flicking your crosshair. Projectiles also snap to opponents within a given range making it a little easier to hit them. A little unreliable since sometimes the projectiles lag behind players without hitting them.

### LaserGuided
Triggered by pressing **left-ctrl + left-alt + 6**.

Projectiles target the location you're aiming at with your crosshair. My personal favourite since it's fairly intuitive to use and very interactive. Projectiles also snap to opponents within a given range making it a little easier to hit them. A little unreliable since sometimes the projectiles lag behind players without hitting them.
